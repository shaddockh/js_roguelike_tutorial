Roguelike Tutorial Workshop
===============

Working through the roguelike tutorials at:
* http://www.codingcookies.com/2013/04/01/building-a-roguelike-in-javascript-part-1/
* http://trystans.blogspot.ca/2011/08/roguelike-tutorial-01-java-eclipse.html

As I work through the tutorial, I'll be making minor adjustments along the way and documenting them as I work through them

Tutorial 01
====
* converted to using Browserify for dependencies
* switched to using the npm version of rot-js ( https://github.com/blinkdog/rot.js )
